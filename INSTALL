INSTALL
=======

  Copy the 'sgbackup' file and the 'sgbackup.config' directory in a directory
  in your $PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin) and remove the sgbackup.conf files for 
  games you dont have. 'sgbackup -l' lists all games by name.
  Edit the sgbackup file and set the BACKUPDIR and the MAX_BACKUP variables 
  according to your needs.
  The BACKUPDIR variable points to the location where you want to keep your
  backups.
  The MAX_BACKUP variable sets the maximum number of backups to keep. Older
  backups are autmatically removed.


GAME INSTALL
============
  To install new games for backup you need to write your own 
  ${game_short}.conf files. This files are sourced by 'sgbackup'.
  The file contains 5 shell variables. Four of them are mandatory.
    * NAME       Full name of the game.
    * SGNAME     short name of the game for use in backup files.
                 !!! It should not contain any whitespace !!!
                 Use underscores '_' instead of space.
    * SGROOT     Root directory of the save game folder.
                 (e.g. "`cygpath \"$USERPROFILE\"`" for users home directory
                 or "`cygpath -O`" for users Documents direcotry)
                 The tar program uses this as base path. 
                 'tar $ARGS -C $SGROOT $SGDIR'
    * SGDIR      The directory to backup.
    * SG_NO_AUTO [OPTIONAL] Set this bariable to "YES" if you want
                 to exclude the game from -a backups.
                 It will automatically set when sgbackup is run with 
                 the -f flag.
